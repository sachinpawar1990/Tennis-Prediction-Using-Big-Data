#Nadal has an excellent endurance on court.
@Chin pei, Nadal 
#The race to deliver the aces decides the match and is exactly what happened in #Nadals case.
@Xander, RAFA keeps hitting aces after the second set which has really added to his game plan
You just throw anything at nadal and he keeps returning them.
After Nadals loss to Kirgios in wimbledon 2013, he has lost his touch completely
Uncle Toni has not proved fruitfull for #NADAL in Australian open 2015
@Shaun , #RAFA is highly dependent on the position of his water bottles which sometimes looses his game.
#Nadal is a shrude and ruthless player. He shows no respect towards his opponents
